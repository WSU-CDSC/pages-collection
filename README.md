# pages-collection

https://github.com/uidaholib/pages-collection

a project to generate a digital collection site using gh-pages given:
- csv of collection metadata
- directory of images or pdfs

Since it uses gh-pages, it is only suitable for small collections, with lower resolution images.
It is intended as a simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries.

Configuration and set up will be as easy as possible, and will be documented step-by-step.
We will prefer commonly understood formats (such as CSV over YAML), and convention over configuration (follow the example over learn all the options).

Layout using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).

## Features
